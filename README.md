This is the repoduction repo for https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49156

When run the page should display Apple and Google login buttons stacked vertically and centered ont he page. What actually happens is the Apple button is incorrectly rendered at the top left corner of the page. This is becasue the coordinates passed from the react-native system to the underlyingiOS code are incorrect.
